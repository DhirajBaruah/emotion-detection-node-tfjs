Learn to make an Image Classifier with Tensorflow.js Node.js and Google Teachable Machine

This video implements the concept of client-side artificial neural networks. We will learn how to run models along with full deep learning applications in the browser! We’ll be using TensorFlow.js (TFJS), a TensorFlow’s JavaScript library, Node.js and Google Teachable Machine.

By the end of this video tutorial, you will have built a web application that runs a neural network in the browser to classify images!
